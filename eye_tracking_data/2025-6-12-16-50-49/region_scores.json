    "ai_diagnosis": "Overall Performance: The total score (70.07) and game scores (ranging 62.9â€“79.1) indicate average to slightly below-average cognitive performance, with variability across tasks.  \n\nBrain Region Analysis:  \n- Executive function (F1) is fair but planning could improve.  \n- Spatial navigation (F2) and visual processing (F4) are average but need refinement.  \n- Memory and mood stability (F3) are fair, with occasional emotional fluctuations.  \n- Auditory and language skills (F5) are fair but require targeted work.  \n\nImprovement Suggestions:  \n1. Executive Function: Practice structured tasks (e.g., scheduling, puzzles) to enhance planning.  \n2. Spatial/Visual Skills: Use spatial exercises (e.g., map reading, visual puzzles) and eye-tracking games.  \n3. Memory/Mood: Engage in mindfulness or memory drills (e.g., recall exercises) and monitor emotional triggers.  \n4. Auditory/Language: Listen to complex audio (e.g., podcasts) and practice language drills (e.g., word games).  \n5. General: Consistent cognitive training (e.g., games 2 & 5, which scored higher) to reinforce strengths.  \n\nPrioritize consistency and gradual challenge increases."
