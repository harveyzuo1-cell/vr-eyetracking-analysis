    "ai_diagnosis": "Overall Performance Assessment: The total score (79.96) indicates above-average cognitive function, with strong executive skills (F1) and spatial attention (F2). Memory (F3) and sensory processing (F4, F5) are solid but slightly lower.  \n\nBrain Region Function Analysis: Executive function (planning, control) and spatial attention are strengths. Visual and auditory processing are adequate but show room for improvement, particularly in consistency (note lower game_4 score).  \n\nSpecific Improvement Suggestions:  \n1. Enhance visual processing (F4) with pattern recognition tasks (e.g., puzzles, speed reading).  \n2. Strengthen auditory-language skills (F5) via active listening exercises (e.g., audiobooks with recall).  \n3. Address variability in performance (game_3, game_4) with focused, timed tasks to build consistency.  \n4. Maintain high-performing areas (F1, F2) with complex problem-solving (e.g., strategy games).  \n\nPrioritize targeted exercises for weaker areas while sustaining strengths."
